                <h2>Machine Learning</h2>
                <p>My primary technical interest lies in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), particularly in their applications within natural language processing (NLP) and data analytics. With advancements in deep learning, the ability to analyze vast datasets and derive meaningful insights has revolutionized various industries, from healthcare to finance. I am particularly fascinated by the development of AI models that can understand, process, and generate human-like text, as well as how these technologies can be integrated to solve complex real-world problems. My interest also extends to the ethical implications and challenges posed by AI, including bias mitigation, transparency, and the development of fair systems.</p>

                 <p>Additionally, I am drawn to the potential of reinforcement learning and neural networks in creating autonomous systems that can adapt to and optimize their environment. Exploring how these systems can be applied in robotics, automation, and optimization tasks excites me. By understanding the underlying mathematics and computational techniques driving these innovations, I aim to contribute to advancing AI technologies that can drive societal progress and innovation.</p>
